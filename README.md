## Premise
This simulation is intended to represent the modeling of cold traps on Mercury, and the movement of H2O molecules across its surface, specifically with reference to how those molecules either 
- Get photodissociated by the sun or atmospheric conditions
- Become trapped in the polar regions at the north and south poles of the planet, where the temperature is not sufficient to provoke jumping
